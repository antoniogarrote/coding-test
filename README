The following is a possible representation of a gas plan that could be stored in some no-sql bullshit database.

    {
    	"supplier_name" : "Scottish Hydro Electric",
    	"name" : "better plan",
    	"annual_standing_charge" : 10000,
    	"discounts" : [
        {
          "applies_to" : "whole-bill",
          "value" : 5,
          "value_type" : "percentage"
          "cap" : null,
        },
        {
          "applies_to" : "rates",
          "value" : 1.0,
          "value_type" : "teir-2"
          "cap" : 50,
        },
        {
          "applies_to" : "rates",
          "value" : 0.6,
          "value_type" : "teir-2"
          "cap" : 30,
        },
    	],
    	"rates" : [
        {
          "price" : 3.5,
          "threshold" : 500,
        },
        {
          "price" : 3.0,
          "threshold" : null,
        }
    	]
    }

Using your favourite programming language (if its ruby or clojure) write an application that

1. Given an annual gas usage (e.g. 25000 kWh) returns you a cost inclusive of VAT.
2. Given an annual cost that has been charged for the plan (e.g. Â£600 inc VAT) return the usage

What you need to know:
======================

VAT on energy is 5%

All plan prices exclude vat.

Annual Standing Charge
----------------------

A flat charged applied for the plan in pence

Rates
-----

Are applied sequentially, up to their threshold which is specified in kWhs

"price": the price in pence for the rate
"threshold": the limit to which this price applies in kWh

Discounts
----------

"applies_to" defines which bill part is applicable for this discount. The possible options are

- **rates**: the total cost of the rates exclusive of annual standing charge
- **whole-bill**: the sum of the rate cost and the annual standing charge 

"value_type" defines the type of discount. The possible values are:

- **percentage**: a percentage of the "applies_to" value
- **tier-2**: applied to the second rate up to a capped value

"cap" the maximum value that a person can receive for this discount
